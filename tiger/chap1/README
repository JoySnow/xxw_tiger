Most parts of code are copied from
https://github.com/geeeeeeeeek/tiger/tree/master/lab0 .
Make some adjustments and personal line comments.

After finish the first chap of book, I have no idea about the tasks.
Also dont undetstand some paragraphs in it.
(seems useless until I start working on code.)
By reading and trying 'ge*k's code,
I read this chap for several more times,
and finally I understood what the books' writter means.
then the code is just quite reasonable.

Thanks. :D
